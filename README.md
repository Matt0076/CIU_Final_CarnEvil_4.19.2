60 seconds of a Grandfather Clock. I needed a clean sample of a Grandfather clock. 
I downloaded http://www.freesound.org/people/daveincamas/sounds/27078 filtered out 
some of the low frequency rumble, sliced out some of the individual sounds, 
then put these into FL Studio as a sequence at 60 bpm. The result is a Hi-Fi 
crystal-locked version of the original recording by daveincamas.

I particularly like some of the extra sounds from the mechanism. 
Thanks for the original sample Dave! :)
